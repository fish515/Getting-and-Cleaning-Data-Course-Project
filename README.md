# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project


This is a project assignment from the Coursera Getting and cleaning data course. 
The purposs of this project is to demostrate the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set.

First is to make sure the program is running under the folder where you unzip https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The program does the following thing in order:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The data is stored in tidydata.txt
